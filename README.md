# The Santroller Platform
The Santroller platform provides the ability to program micro controllers that emulate various rhythm game controllers for computers and various consoles. This is done using the Santroller Configurator, which can program various microcontrollers to emulate different controllers.

Currently, the santroller platform is unreleased, and the older, Ardwiino firmware can be found [here](https://sanjay900.github.io/guitar-configurator/).
