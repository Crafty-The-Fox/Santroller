# Xbox360 Controller Identification and Capabilities
## Controller Identification
Xbox 360 controllers use a concept called [WCID](https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/wiki/WCID-Devices) to identify to windows that they are 360 controllers. Wired controllers use a WCID of "XUSB10", and Wireless controllers use a WCID of "XUSB20". This is implemented in [Descriptors.c](../src/shared/lufa/Descriptors.c) and [XInputOutput.cpp](../src/shared/controller/output/XInputOutput.cpp). Doing this correctly should result in a controller that is detected as an xbox 360 controller, without needing a specific VID or PID.

## Capabilities
There is a write up on ViGEm that shows how to respond with capabilities packets, https://forums.vigem.org/topic/45/rogue-xinput-capabilities-bug-part-2. This is implemented in [XInputOutput.cpp](../src/shared/controller/output/XInputOutput.cpp). This sets up windows to read the capabilities from an unknown descriptor of type 0x21, specified as `{0x00, 0x00, Subtype, 0x25, 0x81, 0x14, 0x03, 0x03, 0x03, 0x04, 0x13, 0x02, 0x08, 0x03, 0x00}`. This is implemented in [Descriptors.c](../src/shared/lufa/Descriptors.c).
