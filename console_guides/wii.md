# Fakemote
The Guitar Hero games on wii require a guitar that is plugged into a Wii remotes extension port, not a USB instrument.
For this reason, an unmodified console will not be able to support a USB guitar, however the [fakemote](https://github.com/sanjay900/fakemote) CIOS module will allow emulating a wii remote + guitar using a USB instrument.
