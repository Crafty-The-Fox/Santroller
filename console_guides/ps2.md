# PS2 Support
Most PS2 games expect a standard PS2 controller, and this can be emulated using the latest [development relase of OPL](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader/releases/download/latest/OPNPS2LD.7z).
With this version of OPL, you can enable `PADEMU`, which will allow for emulating a PS2 Guitar from a PS3 Guitar.
However, some games will just work with USB instruments, including Rock Band, Guitar Hero World Tour and DJ Hero.
