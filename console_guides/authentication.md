# Authentication controllers
Some consoles require controller authentication, such as the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One / Series. For these consoles, you will either need to mod the authentication checks away, or follow the [USB](https://santroller.tangentmc.net/wiring_guides/usb.html) guide, and then plug in an offical controller for authentication.

## Consoles needing authentication
- Xbox 360, though this can be patched away using [UsbdSecPatch](https://santroller.tangentmc.net/console_guides/xbox360.html)
- Xbox One and Series
- PS4, but only when emulating a gamepad or a Guitar Hero Live guitar.
