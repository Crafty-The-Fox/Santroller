# Latency Information

This folder contains latency information about various controllers I have access to.

A controller with a lower poll rate will respond faster than one with a higher poll rate.
The important values are the average poll rate, and the %on time. On time means that the controller responded within a single usb frame, and a higher on time percentage is more responsive.
