# Commercial use of the Santroller platform
The standard tool does not license you to use it for profit. 
However, there is a commercial version of it that can be obtained by subscribing to the projects [GitHub Sponsers](https://github.com/sponsors/sanjay900).

# Features of the commercial tool
* Only the RP2040 is supported by this tool, as we leverage its features to simplify programming for your customers.
* Custom branding, including customisation of device names, logos and colours.
* Ability to build a customer facing tool, that hides most configuration options besides the basics that a customer would need.
  * This will hide things like pin configuration, so that an end user won't be able to mess up their configuration, to avoid support requests after the product is sold.
* Ability to export a UF2 file for easy automation of programming multiple devices at once.
* Simplified tool for the end user, that takes up much less space and programs their devices much quicker.
  * The tool also allows for easy factory resetting as well, which can give you an easy method to revert a customers configuration when providing support.
* Paying for this tool also goes towards providing continual improvements to the tool.
